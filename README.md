A portfolio website written using reactJS probably overkill but it was fun to make.

##Built to showcase my projects as well as to demonstrate my skills.
This website was a fun way to build upon my reactJS knowledge. It is built using HTML5, CSS3, ReactJS, and NodeJS. Yes this is definitely overkill for a website that could have been easily made with mostly HTML and a few lines of javascript. But the whole point was to build my knowledge of react, and this is what came out. This project also helped me develop good management skills and taught me better ways to organize my projects file structure, as well as a way to build more scalable and mantainable code.

To setup do the following:
```
npm install express

cd /client

npm install materialize-css@next reactjs


```

and you're good to go! If you like what you see, hire me!
